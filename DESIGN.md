# EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR

When the ball is hit by the cue, which is activated once the input is down (Space, in this case) a force is applied to the ball. Then, It should be impulsed by that force
and hit the others, applying them forces too. 

The cue must be rotated around the ball at will for a good billiards gameplay, so we make for each side of the X and Y axis (up, down, left and right) an input that makes
it rotate in each one of these directions once their assigned input is pulsed, and combine them for diagonal.
